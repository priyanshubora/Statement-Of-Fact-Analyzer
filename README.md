# SOFA - Statement Of Fact Analyzer
# Project Info
The project aims to automate the extraction, analysis, and calculation of laytime for vessels using AI techniques. Instead of going through long Statement of Facts (SOF) documents manually, our system processes them quickly and provides accurate laytime results. It also helps in determining demurrage (extra charges when laytime is exceeded) and dispatch (rebate when loading/unloading finishes earlier), making the overall process faster and more reliable.

# Features

 - Automated SOF Extraction – Extracts key events and timestamps from SOF documents.

 - Laytime Calculation – Provides accurate calculation of laytime based on extracted facts.

 - AI-Powered Analysis – Uses artificial intelligence to interpret unstructured text.

 - User-Friendly Web Interface – Clean and modern interface built with Tailwind CSS.

 - Fast Deployment – Hosted on Vercel for quick and reliable access.



# Summary of the Solution

Our Statement of Fact Analyzer leverages artificial intelligence to extract critical data points from SOF documents and accurately calculate laytime. This reduces manual workload, minimizes errors, and helps shipping companies save both time and money. By integrating AI-based text analysis with an intuitive web interface, the system enables users to upload documents, automatically process them, and receive structured outputs for decision-making.
