-> Problem Statement

Extraction of statement of facts using artificial intelligence to analyze and calculate the laytime.
The project focuses on simplifying the manual and error-prone process of interpreting Statement of Facts (SOF) documents. It aims to automate the extraction, analysis, and calculation of laytime for vessels using AI techniques.

-> Summary of the Solution

Our Statement of Fact Analyzer leverages artificial intelligence to extract critical data points from SOF documents and accurately calculate laytime. This reduces manual workload, minimizes errors, and helps shipping companies save both time and money.

By integrating AI-based text analysis with an intuitive web interface, the system enables users to upload documents, automatically process them, and receive structured outputs for decision-making.

-> Key Features

 Automated SOF Extraction – Extracts key events and timestamps from SOF documents.

 Laytime Calculation – Provides accurate calculation of laytime based on extracted facts.

 AI-Powered Analysis – Uses artificial intelligence to interpret unstructured text.

 User-Friendly Web Interface – Clean and modern interface built with Tailwind CSS.

 Fast Deployment – Hosted on Vercel for quick and reliable access.
